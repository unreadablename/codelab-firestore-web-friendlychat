# Codelab Firestore Web Friendly Chat
This codelab is meant as a sequel of the [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/)

Also you can continue after codelab [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions/)

This codelab is going to describe the process of upgrading your existing Firebase powered Friendly Chat to using the power of [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
